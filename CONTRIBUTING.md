# Contributing to Our Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We welcome contributions from everyone. This document provides some guidelines for contributing.

## Development Environment

We use 4 spaces for indentation. Our code is formatted with [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), linted with [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/), and type-checked with [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/). We write tests with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure your code is formatted, linted, type-checked, and all tests pass.

## Branch Naming Convention

To allow proper autolabeling of changes, please name your branches as follows:

- `feature/*` or `features/*`: for feature enhancements or new features
- `fix/*`: for fixes to existing features
- `test/*` or `tests/*`: for changes to the unit tests or their configuration
- `doc/*` or `docs/*`: for changes to the documentation
- `action/*` or `actions/*`: for changes to the CI/CD pipelines
- `chore/*`: for any other change not directly related to a user feature

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code, add tests. Make sure all tests pass.
3. If you've changed the public interface of this library, update the documentation.
4. Ensure your code is formatted with Black, linted with Pylint, and type-checked with Mypy.
5. Issue your pull request!

## Reporting a Bug

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/CAME-Domotic-unofficial/came_domotic_unofficial/issues); it's that easy!
